I finished setting up the files for the game, and I changed some settings for pixel art since we're planning on doing a pixel game. I also added the hackatime extension

I forgot to journal this yesterday becuase I was not at my computer, but I was playing around with character ideas in Procreate and I made this little guy! Unfortunately, because it was I 32x32 pixel canvas, Procreate's built in timelapseing function didn't work. I didn't know this before, but I guess there's a minimum canvas size for it to work, so I guess I'll be manually recording it from now on for my small pixel art assets. Thankfully, Procreate does have a feature where it tells you how long you spent on a canvas, so I have that!

I took a few minutes to set up a barebones main menu. It's not connected to anything, but it's just a basic setup.
