I'm currently working on getting the repo and a Godot project set up

I finished setting up the files for the game, and I changed some settings for pixel art since we're planning on doing a pixel game. I also added the hackatime extension

I forgot to journal this yesterday becuase I was not at my computer, but I was playing around with character ideas in Procreate and I made this little guy! Unfortunately, because it was I 32x32 pixel canvas, Procreate's built in timelapseing function didn't work. I didn't know this before, but I guess there's a minimum canvas size for it to work, so I guess I'll be manually recording it from now on for my small pixel art assets. Thankfully, Procreate does have a feature where it tells you how long you spent on a canvas, so I have that!

I took a few minutes to set up a barebones main menu. It's not connected to anything, but it's just a basic setup.

I forgot to journal this yesterday, but I made a neon-style tilemap! I might add more to it in the future, but I think I like it so far. (sorry the timelapse is such low quality, I forgot to set it to best instead of good)

I set up a world and player with a script. It's not much, but at least I got something done. Also I brainstormed a bit. The idea is basically that you shake for maximally 2 seconds to jump. You can tilt to move left/right during the jump. I got inspired by the little game you could always play on the google play store, I believe it also worked with tilting. Hopefully I can do something more tomorrow, but I'm really busy.

I made the player script in ~30 minutes! It needed some changing because our console is going to be tilt'n'shake. Wow, I just thought of this but it's a pretty fun name actually! Basically when you press A and D will correspond to the console being "level" and thus you don't move. When you press A or D it's tilted to one of the sides and it will move. Jump is spacebar and you can press it for 2 seconds max.
